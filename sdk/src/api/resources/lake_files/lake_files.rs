    /// This endpoint returns a list of MCAP files in the lake bucket for a given Primary Site.
    ///
    /// For each recording that has been imported, multiple files are created â€” one per topic.

    /// This endpoint is only supported for self-managed sites.
    ///
    /// A query must be limited to a device or recording using one of the following parameters:
    /// - deviceId
    /// - deviceName
    /// - recordingId
    /// - recordingKey
    ///
    /// If querying by a device (ID or name), you must also provide `start` and `end` parameters to limit the range of files included.
    ///
    /// The range expressed by `start` and `end` must not exceed 24h.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `site_id` - The ID of a self-managed Primary Site for which the files have been imported
    /// * `device_id` - ID of the device associated with the imported files
    /// * `device_name` - Name of the device associated with the imported files
    /// * `recording_id` - A recording ID for which the files have been imported
    /// * `recording_key` - A recording key for which the files have been imported
    /// * `start` - Inclusive start of an imported recording's time range. If start is provided, end must be too.
    /// * `end` - Inclusive end of an imported recording's time range. If end is provided, start must be too.
    /// * `topic` - Include only imported files matching this topic name
    /// * `options` - Additional request options such as headers, timeout, etc.
